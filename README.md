# SMFST

Single-Molecule Force Spectroscopy Toolkit (SMFST), a powerful tool used to study Force spectroscopy data. Itâ€™s a MATLAB-based software with a friendly graphical interface and efficient processing. The toolkit can be used for analyzing Force-Extension curves collected by different technologies and extended for new mathematical models in the future.

When using our software in a research project, there is no need to list us as the corresponding author of the article, just mention it explicitly in the acknowledgements section.

We are also constantly working on bug improvements, so please contact us if you would like to get the latest version of the software.
